# Changelog

## 2.14.0 - 5 Jul 2022

### Added

Add configuration open for turn removal feature (enabled by default) [#14](https://github.com/arcanistzed/scs/issues/14)

### Fixed

CSS padding issue that caused arrow buttons to not be visible

## 2.13.0 - 4 Jul 2022

Removed the default keys for the keybinding for better compatibility (users can define their own)

### Added

* As part of the "display" feature, a flag is now set on actors with their last attack roll. This could be used in a custom [Combat Tracker Groups](https://github.com/arcanistzed/ctg) grouping mode, for example.
* Refactor CSS completely
  * New scroll snapping
* Configuration form to enable complete manual configuration of all colors

### Fixed

* Refactors to color generation and display
* Make phase and round switching more predictable
* Don't start combat if the Combat Tracker is not hidden (thanks to @Lethay)

## 2.12.0 - 13 Dec 2021

### Added

* Localized everything to make the "display" and "Action Locking" features work in other languages

### Fixed

* Removed separate round value since it was causing bugs with de-sync and making it so that you aren't able to advance the round at all. This separation was created because I originally wanted the SCS to work without any core combats active, but that no longer makes sense because they are now synchronized anyway

## 2.11.2 - 11 Dec 2021

### Fixed

* Error with display enabled when there is no flavor text in rolls
* Remove conflicting Keybindings

## 2.11.1 - 7 Dec 2021

### Fixed

* Use MidiQoL's hook
* Only attempt to add the Combat Tracker display if a combatant exists

## 2.11.0 - 7 Dec 2021

* IntroJS is now a soft dependency which you only need to install for the tutorial
* Inverted default Combat Tracker visibility setting

### Added

* Removed the concept of turns from the Combat Tracker:
  * Previous and Next turn buttons are hidden
  * No combatant is highlighted as the current combatant as there is no one taking their turn (requires v9d2 or later)
* Keybindings for switching phase and round as well as toggling app visibility (requires v9d2 or later)
* Major rework of the HUD feature which has been renamed to the more generic "Attack Display" and now includes an option to display the last roll in the Combat Tracker

### Fixed

* Always move above SmallTime no matter what it's height happens to be
* Attack Display works with MidiQoL
* Attack Display HUD is more consistently centered

## 2.10.0 - 19 Nov 2021

### Added

* Hide App when there is no Combat encounter
* End combat when all of the combatants have been removed

### Fixed

* Create a new combat if one doesn't exist if the round isn't zero
* Only allow GM users to change the phase or round with the API
* Bug fixes and improvements
* Code Quality improvements
* Fixed default settings in v9d2 which were messed up now that arrays can't be localized

* *Action Locking:* the notification for an unrecognized phase is now GM-only
* *Combat Management:*
  * Added a prompt to end the current combat when the round becomes zero
  * Create a new Combat whenever the round becomes greater than zero
* *Color Generation:* player clients no longer reload after a delay

## 2.8.0 - 16 Sept 2021 - Module Compatibility

## 2.6.0 - 29 Aug 2021 - Attack Roll HUD

In order to ease determining the attack order (for example, in the default attack phase), the module shows you the last attack roll in the token's HUD. This currently only works in D&D 5e and PF 2e.

## 2.5.0 - 26 Aug 2021 - More API and Fixes

* Updated localisations

## 2.2.1 - 13 Aug 2021

There was a super annoying bug where the app would go into an update loop which took like 10 hours to debug

* Fixed a bug for anyone that doesn't have SmallTime installed

## 0.4.0 - 23 Jun 2021 - About Time for Gradients

Added integration with About Time, so that changing rounds updates the game's time. Currently, the time is not paused during combat as I still have to figure out how to do that.

Also, added some gradients to make it look nicer âœ¨
